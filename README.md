# sample_size_calculator

This is an app to calculate the minimum required sample size for a 2 sample hypothesis test. It allows the user to input baseline probability, minimum detectable effect size, power and confidence level. It calculates the sample size using these parameters and also generates plots showing the relationship between power, effect size and sample size.
